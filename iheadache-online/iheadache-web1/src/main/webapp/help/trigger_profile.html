<h1>Tracking your Triggers</h1>
<p>(My Profile Tab &gt;Trigger Profile)</p>
<p>Use this page to set the possible headache triggers you desire to track. This way you only see the triggers that <u>you</u> want to track instead our entire list of over 40 triggers.</p>
<h2><a name="CommonTriggers" id="CommonTriggers">Common [Trigger] Tab</a>&nbsp; </h2>
<p>The common trigger list has headache triggers that are most commonly identified by physicians and research. Check off the triggers you wish to track.&nbsp; If you decide that you don&rsquo;t want to track a particular trigger anymore, then just uncheck it. </p>
<h2><a name="CustomTriggers" id="CustomTriggers">Custom [Trigger] Tab</a></h2>
<p>Triggers that are not in the common list can be added to our &ldquo;Custom Tab&rdquo; This allows you to track as many triggers as desired.&nbsp; Click Add and enter the desired trigger.&nbsp; You must hit the update button and the <strong>OK button </strong>to save your entry.</p>
<ul>
  <li>To stop tracking the custom trigger but allow yourself to track it later, unclick the &ldquo;track&rdquo; box.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>If you no longer wish to ever track a custom trigger, you can select a trigger and hit the delete button but this is not recommended.&nbsp; It is better to just &ldquo;uncheck&rdquo; it and not include it in your Trigger Profile.</li>
</ul>
