<h1>Setting iHeadache Preferences</h1>
<p>(My Profile Tab &gt; Acute Treatments)</p>
<p>iHeadache uses rules inspired by the International Headache Society to determine headache type (Migraine, Probable Migraine, and Tension types are currently supported). The &ldquo;My Profile&rdquo; area is used to set application &ldquo;preferences&rdquo; that are used for headache classification and reports. Want to learn more about headache classifications or types? <u><a href="http://ihs-classification.org/en/02_klassifikation/">Click here</a></u> to read about the International Headache Society headache classification.</p>
<h2><a name="HeadacheOrderTestPreference" id="HeadacheOrderTestPreference"></a>Headache Order Test Preference</h2>
<p>It is possible for a single headache to meet criteria for both Tension Type Headache and Probable Migraine Headache.&nbsp; For those headaches that meet both criteria, the system will report the one the one that you specify here. </p>
<h2><a name="HeadacheDurationRules" id="HeadacheDurationRules">Headache Duration Rules</a></h2>
<p>The diagnosis of migraine headache requires an individual headache to last at least 4 hours (or less than 4 hours if an acute headache specific medication is taken).&nbsp; The diagnosis of tension headache requires an individual headache to last at least 30 minutes.&nbsp; Since many users forget to put in headache duration the following options can be set.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Use duration if entered</em></strong>&nbsp; - We recommend using this setting.&nbsp; The system will use the time criteria when it has been entered and ignore time criteria when it is not entered and not needed to classify the headache type.&nbsp; If the system can determine the headache type based upon the data entered, it will display the headache type as tension, migraine, or probable migraine. If there is not enough info about the headache to determine the type then the type will be set to &ldquo;Unclassified Headache&rdquo;.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Ignore Duration</em></strong> - The headache duration will be ignored and not used in any of the headache classification analysis.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Require Duration</em></strong> – The time requirements will be required for classification of all headaches.&nbsp; Therefore, all headaches without a stop time will be classified as &ldquo;Unclassified Headache&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="DisplayNamesInReports" id="DisplayNamesInReports">Display Medication Names in Reports</a></h2>
<p>You may use trade names, generic names, or both generic and trade names in reports. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Trade (Brand) name examples are:&nbsp; Imitrex®, Topamax®, Advil®</li>
  <li>Grand name examples are:&nbsp; Sumatriptan, Topiramate, Ibuprofen</li>
