<h2>Your Preventative Treatment Profile</h2>
<p>(My Profile Tab &gt; Preventatives)</p>
<p>Your Preventative Treatment Profile is where you track treatments that you take to help prevent headaches (prophylaxis) rather than treatments that you take in response to an actual headache.</p>
<p>This part of the app works just like &ldquo;acute treatment&rdquo; profile in that you have common and custom tabs.&nbsp; By clicking on the column heading you may sort your common and custom medications by trade (brand) name and generic name. Click the P checkmark next to preventative treatments that you want to be included in your profile.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You are only specifying the treatments that will be included in your &ldquo;preventive treatment profile&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp; You will go the Preventatives tab to select start dates, stop dates, and medication dosage.</p>
<h3><a name="common" id="common">Common [Preventatives] Tab</a></h3>
<p>The common tab lists about 50 of the most common treatments that have been shown to prevent headaches.&nbsp; To add preventive treatments to your profile:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Select the  checkbox next to the names of the drugs that you want to add to your profile. </li>
  <li>Click the OK button to commmit all your changes.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note:&nbsp; The presence of a medication on this list does not represent any type of endorsement by Better QOL, Inc.  </em></p>
<h3><a name="custom" id="custom">Custom [Preventatives] Tab</a></h3>
<p>To add a preventive treatments that&rsquo;s not on our &ldquo;common tab&rdquo;, choose the &ldquo;custom tab&rdquo; and you can set up your own custom preventive treatments.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Add a custom preventative treatment </strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>click the &ldquo;add&rdquo; button and fill in the requested information. </li>
  <li>The included column shows all the custom treatments that are in your profile so make sure that there is a checkmark by the treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp; If at a later date you don&rsquo;t want to see this treatment you can always uncheck it.</li>
  <li>You can choose to enter a Trade Name and/or Generic Name.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; Both fields are required in our system If you are only going to use one name then we recommend that you duplicate the name in both columns.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>Click the update button.&nbsp; Now you will see the treatment in your custom list.</li>
  <li>You can continue making any other changes to your profile but note, our changes are not applied until you press  the <strong>OK button</strong> at the bottom to save the entry.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Inactivate</strong> a custom preventative medication </h3>
<ul>
  <li>To &ldquo;Inactivate&rdquo; a custom medication - If you think you may want to return to this medication later, but do not want it to currently appear on your active drug list, then uncheck the &ldquo;included&rdquo; checkbox.<strong></strong></li>
  
  <li> If you prefer to delete the medication then click on the medication you wish to delete and then press the &ldquo;delete button&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: If you delete or inactivate a medication(s) from your profile, it will still be shown on your prior headaches.&nbsp; It will just not be available for future headaches.</em></p>
