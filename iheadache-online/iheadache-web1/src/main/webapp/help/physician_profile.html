<h2>Allowing  Your Physican(s) to View Your Diary</a></h2>
<p>(My Profile Tab &gt;Physicians)</p>
<p>We have had many of our the physician's who reccomed iHeadache to their patients ask about having access to the electronic data from iHeadache.&nbsp; This way they can cut/paste data or import your entire report to their Electronic Medical Records (EMR). </p>
<h3><a name="AddingMD" id="AddingMD">Adding your Physician/Provider&nbsp; </a>(is this how it is supposed to work?)</h3>
<p>To allow a physician or provider to look at your headache data then you can add your name and data to be included in their patient list.&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
  <li>Click the &ldquo;add&rdquo; button and a list of physician/providers will open.&nbsp; Double click on the name you want to add.&nbsp; You can also search for a provider by entering data in the &ldquo;search box&rdquo;.</li>
  <li>You can add multiple providers.&nbsp; For example if you see a physician and their nurse provider then you can add them both.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>The providers will get an email that you requested access and then can &ldquo;confirm&rdquo; or &ldquo;decline&rdquo; you as their patient.<em></em></li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="ProviderNotUser" id="ProviderNotUser">If your provider is not on our list</a></h3>
<p>If your physician is not on this list, then he has not registered with iHeadache.&nbsp; Please click here and fill out this online form and we can contact them about becoming registered. Or you can download a brochure to take to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em> (need link to both)</em></strong></p>
