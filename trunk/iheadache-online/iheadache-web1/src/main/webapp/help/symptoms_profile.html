<h2>Tracking Custom Symptoms</h2>
<p>We ask the specific questions about your headaches because they are used to help determine the type of headache (migraine, tension, etc.) you are having.&nbsp; Users have requested that we add &ldquo;custom symptom tracking&rdquo; so we have done this!&nbsp; You can add an unlimited number of &ldquo;Custom Symptoms&rdquo; to track.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Keep in mind you will still have to answer our typical symptoms questions in order for iHeadache to determine the headache type.</p>

<p>Many users desire to track symptoms that are not included on the standard symptom list.&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
  <li>Add a custom symptom - click the &ldquo;add&rdquo; button and enter the symptom.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>If you want to stop tracking a custom symptom but may want to follow it later, uncheck the include box.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>This is not recommended but if you do not wish to ever use a custom symptom again then you may delete the symptom by selecting the entire line and clicking the delete button.&nbsp; Beware: deleting this custom symptom may make the reports inaccurate from the time period that you used to track this custom symptom.&nbsp; Is really best to just choose to &ldquo;not include&rdquo; in your profile by &ldquo;unchecking&rdquo; the box. </li>
</ul>
