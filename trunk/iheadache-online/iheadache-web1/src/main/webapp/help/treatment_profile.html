<h1><a>Your Acute Treatment Profile </a></h1>
<p>(My Profile Tab &gt; Acute Treatments)</p>
<p>You probably just have a few treatments, whether they be medication or Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) treatments, that you take during your headaches so you only want to add these to your &ldquo;Acute Treatment Profile&quot;.&nbsp; iHeadache has XX acute headache treatments and XX preventative treatments already setup in our system. When you are having a headache the last thing you want to do is sort through a long list of acute treatments.</p>
<p>The purpose of this page is to enter the acute medications or treatments that you use when you have an actual headache.&nbsp; We refer to these as &ldquo;acute treatments&rdquo; since they are used to alleviate your current symptoms and they are only taken when necessary. They are typically not taken on a daily basis like preventative (prophylaxis) medications. </p>
<p>Clicking on the column-heading sorts your common and custom treatments by trade name (aka: brand name), generic name, form, dose, and whether the medication is migraine specific.</p>
<p>Click the checkmark next to treatments that you want to be included when you are entering a headache.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t want to see the medication anymore then you can uncheck it from your profile. If at a later date you decide that you want to use the medicine again, you can always recheck it and it will show back up in your&nbsp; &ldquo;Acute Treatment Profile&rdquo;.&nbsp; Unchecking a medication does not remove it from the current headaches and will not affect reports.</p>
<h3>Common [Acute Treatments] Tab</a></h3>
<p>This tab shows treatments that are either FDA approved for acute migraine headache treatment or are medications that many physicians use (off label) to treat migraines and other headaches. You can sort the list by the trade name (brand name), generic name, the form, dose, or whether it is a migraine specific medication by clicking on the column heading you wish to sort by.&nbsp; Check the box at the far left for those medications you want to be on your profile.&nbsp; <br>
  <strong>Click &ldquo;OK&rdquo; at the bottom of the screen to save your changes. </strong><br>
  <br>
<i>Note:&nbsp; The presence of a medication on this list does not represent any type of endorsement.</i></p>
<h3>Custom [Acute Treatments] Tab</a></h3>
<p>You can enter a treatment that is not listed on the &ldquo;Common&rdquo; tab.&nbsp; If there is an acute treatment or medication that you take for your headache, which is not on the common list, then click the custom tab to add it to your profile.&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Add</b> a custom medication or treatment - click the add button and fill in the requested information.&nbsp; </li>
    <ul>
      <li>The included column shows all the custom treatments that are in your profile so make sure that there is a R checkmark by the treatment.&nbsp; If at a later date you don&rsquo;t want to see this treatment you can always uncheck it.</li>
      <li>You can choose to enter a Trade Name and/or Generic Name.</li>
      <li>The &ldquo;form&rdquo; of the treatments is a way for you to identify the type of treatment.&nbsp; Common forms include injection, capsule, and suppository.&nbsp; If you are doing other things such as acupuncture, massage or other Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) treatments then you can identify them and CAM.</li>
      <li>The &ldquo;dose&rdquo; of the treatment is the milligrams, micrograms or other terms you use to describe how much of the medication you&rsquo;re&nbsp; taking.</li>
      <li>The &ldquo;Migraine Specific&rdquo; column is for medications that are prescribed specifically to treat migraines.&nbsp; This setting is used when determining the headache classification.&nbsp; In general, only a medication that only treats migraines is considered migraine specific.&nbsp; Sumatriptan or dihydroergotamine are examples of migraine specific therapy, ibuprofen or tylenol is an example of a medication that is not migraine specific.&nbsp; Excedrin migraine is also considered a non-migraine specific medication because its ingredients are used to treat other types of pain.</li>
      <li>Click the update and the <b>OK button</b> to save your entry.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Delete</b> a custom medication - click on the medication you wish to delete and then press the delete button.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of the leading a custom medication we feel like it would be better if you just unchecked &ldquo;included&rdquo; so the medication is still available in your profile but it just doesn&rsquo;t show up unless it&rsquo;s &ldquo;included&rdquo;.<b></b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>To simply Inactivate a custom medication - If you think you may want to return to this medication later, but do not want it to currently appear on your active drug list, then uncheck the &ldquo;included&rdquo; checkbox.<b></b></li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<i>Note: If you delete or inactivate a medication(s) from your profile, it will still be shown on your prior headaches.&nbsp; It will just not be available for future headaches.</i><b></b></p>
